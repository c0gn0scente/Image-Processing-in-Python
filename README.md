TIFF IMAGE MANIPULATION USING Python Imaging Library(PIL) PILLOW


#To manipulate a Tagged Image File Format(TIFF) Image using Python Imaging Library(PIL) Pillow 4.0 and 
 perform following actions on the input image:
  1.	Displaying Input Image
  2.	Resize Image File
  3.	Display Image Details and Attributes
  4.	Change Mode of Image
  5.	Change Contrast of Image
  6.	Rotate Image
  7.	Blur Image
  8.	Display Contour of Image
  9.	Display Image after Convolution
  10.	Crop Image
  11.	Mean and Median of Image
  12.	Standard Deviation of Image
  13.	Variance of Image
  14.	Root Mean Square of Image 
  15.	Histogram of Image
 

  Tagged Image File Format, abbreviated TIFF or TIF, is a computer file format for storing raster graphics images, popular among graphic artists, the publishing industry, and photographers. The TIFF format is widely supported by image-manipulation applications, by publishing and page layout applications, and by scanning, faxing, word processing, optical character recognition and other applications.
  The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter. This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities. The core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few basic pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image processing tool.
  In this Project TIFF image is read via input name and Manipulated using Python Imaging Library Pillow. Pillow i.e. PIL Fork has large number of classes which help in easy image manipulation using image attributes and pixel values.
